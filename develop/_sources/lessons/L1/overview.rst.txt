Lesson overview
===============

In this week's lesson we will introduce you a spatial data model (geometric objects) and some basics of how spatial data
can be manipulated in pure Python.

1. :doc:`Geometric Objects - Spatial Data Model <Geometric-Objects>`

    -  `Overview of Geometric Objects and Shapely -module <Geometric-Objects.html#overview-of-geometric-objects-and-shapely-module>`__
    -  `Point -object <Geometric-Objects.html#point>`__
    -  `LineString -object <Geometric-Objects.html#linestring>`__
    -  `Polygon -object <Geometric-Objects.html#polygon>`__
    -  `Geometry collections (optional) <Geometric-Objects.html#geometry-collections-optional>`__

2. :doc:`Exercise 1: Working with geometric objects <ex-1>`
3. :doc:`Exercise 1 hints <exercise-1-hints>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this week you should:

  - have an idea of what kind of tools are available for doing GIS in Python
  - know how to install Python packages using conda
  - know what kind of geometric objects are available
  - know how to create different kind of geometries using Shapely
  - know how to read coordinates from a file and create Points based on those
