Lesson 2 Overview
=================

In this lesson, we will learn how to handle spatial data in Python using
`Geopandas <http://geopandas.org/>`_. Geopandas combines the power of Pandas to analyze tabular data,
and Shapely for handling geometries. Furthermore, geopandas relies on other packages such as fiona for reading and
writing files, pyproj for managing coordinate reference systems, and matplotlib for plotting.

In particular, we will learn how to read and write spatial data in Python,
and to manipulate geometries in a GeoDataFrame. Furthermore, we will learn to re-project data between
coordinate reference systems (crs).


Learning goals
--------------

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Read and write spatial data from/to common file formats
- Conduct simple analysis on spatial and non-spatial data
- Manage coordinate reference systems and re-project data
