Lesson 5 Overview
=================

This week we will focus on learning how to create beautiful maps in Python and how to share them on GitHub using `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_.
We already covered the basics of plotting in Python during the `Geo-Python course week 7 <https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L7/overview.html>`_.
As you might remember from that lesson, there are many different Python modules that can be used for making visualizations, and many of them also allows you to create different kinds of maps.

During this lesson, we will the use of these modules for plotting static and interactive maps:

 - `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ (static maps, integrated into `Geopandas <http://geopandas.org/>`_)
 - `Folium <https://github.com/python-visualization/folium>`_ (interactive Web maps on Leaflet)
 - `Contextily <https://github.com/darribas/contextily>`_ (for adding basemaps)


Other useful modules to check out (not covered in these course materials):
 - `Plotly express <https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/>`_ (interactive plots and maps, install using `conda install -c conda-forge plotly`)
 - `Plotly Dash <https://plot.ly/dash/>`__ (interactive analytics dashboards)
 - `HoloViews <http://holoviews.org/>`__ and `GeoViews <http://geoviews.org/>`_ 
 - `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_ (interactive plots)

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks lesson you should be able to:

 - Create a static map using geopandas / matplotlib / contextily
 - Create a simple interactive map using Folium
 - Share your maps (static / interactive) on GitHub using GitHub pages.
