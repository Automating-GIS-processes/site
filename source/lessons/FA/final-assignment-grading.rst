Grading criteria for the final assignment
==========================================

**The grading is based on a typical 0-5 scale. The grade is based on a total of 70 points:**


**50 points points for major analysis steps/ functionality**:

	- Reading and manipulating data
    - Analyzing data
    - Visualizations (maps, graphs)
    - Is the code written in a modular way (avoid repetition eg. using functions and for-loops)
    - Does everything work as it should
    - Overall difficulty of the analysis task is taken into account in the assessment

**10 points for overall documentation of the work**

	- is there a general description in about the research problem / purpose of the tool?
	- is the usage of the tool/ available functions described and demonstrated clearly?
	- are all input data and output results (maps, graphs) presented and explained clearly?
    - Is the code easy to read and well-formatted (following the PEP8 guidelines)

**10 points** for other merits in the work (if aiming for the highest grade):

	- something in the work is exceptionally well done
	- some problem in the code is solved in a "smart" way
	- the work is exceptionally well documented
	- the visualizations are exceptionally good
	- additional features are added (eg. steps 5-6 in accesViz, or some other features that were not required)


This grading criteria applies to submissions which contain the following sections:

1. **Data acquisition** (Fetching data, subsetting data, storing intermediate outputs etc.)
2. **Data analysis** (Enriching and analyzing the data, eg. spatial join, overlay, buffering, other calculations..)
3. **Visualization** (Visualizing main results and other relevant information as maps and graphs)

You can write your code into python script files and /or jupyter notebook files. You can freely organize your final work into one single file, or several files (for example, write your own functions into a separate `.py` file and apply them in one or several jupyter notebook `.ipynb` files.

**The workflow should be repeatable and well documented.** In other words, anyone who gets a copy of your repository should be able to run your code, and read your code.

In case you are creating something with a totally different structure, please discuss with the course instructors :)
