Overview
========

In this lesson, we will continue to learn how to manipulate and analyse spatial data using Geopandas, Shapely and other
relevant Python packages. First, we will learn how to geocode addresses, i.e. convert addresses into coodrinates.
Next, we will focus on spatial queries and we will learn how to join data based on spatial information. Finally, we will conduct
nearest neighbor analysis between a set of points.

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks' lesson you should be able to:

 - Geocode data, i.e. transform addresses into coordinates
 - Conduct point-in-polygon queries
 - Make spatial joins
 - Conduct nearest neighbour analysis (finding the closest point).
