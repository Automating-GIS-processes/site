Lesson overview
===============

Before starting to work with actual GIS data, we will focus on basic geometric objects such as points, lines and
polygons. In this lesson, you will learn how to create and manipulate geometries in Python
using the `Shapely Python Package <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html#spatial-data-model>`__.

Learning goals
--------------

After this lesson you should be able to:

- search for information about the available GIS packages in Python
- understand how geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons are represented in Python using Shapely
- create geometric objects based on coordinate values
- (optionally) install Python packages on your own computer using conda
