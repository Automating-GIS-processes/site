Overview
========

For the Python GIS course at CSC in March 2022, most of below lessons have been combined to a 'usecase' lesson about finding out how the trees of Seurasaari were doing in summer 2021, which can be found `here <../../notebooks/Raster/Raster_CSC/Seurasaari_trees.ipynb>`__


In this tutorial, you will learn how to conduct many basic raster processing operations using ``rasterio`` module.
