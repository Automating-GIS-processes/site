    "Python has a specific module called [Shapely](http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html) for doing various geometric operations. \n",
    "There are many useful functionalities that you can do with Shapely such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Create a `Line` or `Polygon` from a `Collection` of `Point` -geometries\n",
    "-  Calculate areas/length/bounds etc. of input geometries\n",
    "-  Conduct geometric operations based on the input geometries such as `Union`, `Difference`, `Distance` etc.\n",
    "-  Conduct spatial queries between geometries such as `Intersects`, `Touches`, `Crosses`, `Within` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Objects consist of coordinate tuples where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `Point` -object represents a single point in space. Points can be either two-dimensional (x, y) or three dimensional (x, y, z).\n",
    "-  `LineString` -object (i.e. a line) represents a sequence of points joined together to form a line. Hence, a line consist of a list of at least two coordinate tuples\n",
    "-  `Polygon` -object represents a filled area that consists of a list of at least three coordinate tuples that forms the outerior ring and a (possible) list of hole polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is also possible to have a collection of geometric objects (e.g. Polygons with multiple parts):**\n",

    "-  `MultiLineString` -object represents a collection of lines and consists of a list of line-like sequences\n",

    "[Tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences) is a Python data structure that consists of a nuber of values separated by commas. Coordinate pairs are often represented as a tuple. For example:\n",

Tuples have many similarities with lists and ranges, but they are often used for different purposes. The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are [immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable), which means that the contents of a tuple cannot be altered (while lists are mutable; you can, for example, add and remove values from lists).\n",
