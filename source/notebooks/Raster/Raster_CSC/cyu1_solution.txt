# Test your understanding:

# Something seems off about the histogram, can you find out what and fix it? (Hint: check the shape of stack)

# check that we have the data in correct format for show_hist (bands, height, width)

print("first fix")

print(falsecolor_stack.shape)
stack_for_hist = np.transpose(falsecolor_stack,axes=[2,0,1])
print(stack_for_hist.shape)

# and plot the histogram

show_hist(stack_for_hist, bins=50, lw=0, stacked=False, alpha=0.9,histtype="stepfilled")

# The basic output of the histogram function is not very nice and even wrong in one place, can you do better? (Hint: show_hist also takes matplotlib axes (`ax=`) and title `title=` as optional parameters)

# add labels (we know that nir is first, red, is second and green is third band in our stack) using label
# add descriptive title 
# adjust x-axis label by using matplotlibs axis to reflect what is actually shown in our case 

print("second fix")

show_hist(stack_for_hist, bins=50, lw=0, stacked=False, alpha=0.9,histtype="stepfilled", label = ["nir","red","green"], title = "Histogram Sentinel-2 false color stack", ax = ax)
ax.set_xlabel("Reflectance")

# in this case the histogram could also be plotted using only matplotlib.pyplot
