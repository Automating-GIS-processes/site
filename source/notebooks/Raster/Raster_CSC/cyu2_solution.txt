#Test your understanding:

#* In above plot we do not have Coordinates at the plot, why? 

print(type(ndvi))

# -> array, does not have any coordinates attached

# How could we get them?

# -> plot the newly saved file

with rasterio.open("./data/S2_NDVI_Seurasaari.tif") as src:
    show(src, title="Read from saved NDVI geotiff")

# We could also pass the transform with the array to 'show'

show(ndvi, transform=seurasaariS2.transform, title="NDVI array with transform")
