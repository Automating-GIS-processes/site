# Grading criteria for the final assignment

**The grading is based on a typical 0-5 scale.**

The following aspects are considered in the assessment

**Data preparation, analysis & visualization (3/5 of final grade)**:

- Reading and manipulating data
- (Spatial) data analysis steps
- Quality of visualizations (maps, graphs)
- Is the code written in a modular way (avoid repetition eg. using functions and for-loops)
- Does everything work as it should
- Overall difficulty of the analysis task is taken into account in the assessment

**Overall documentation of the work (1/5 of final grade)**

- Is there a general description in about the research problem / purpose of the tool?
- Is the usage of the tool/ available functions described and demonstrated clearly?
- Are all input data and output results (maps, graphs) presented and explained clearly?
- Is the code easy to read and well-formatted (following the PEP8 guidelines)

**Other merits in the work (~1/5 of final grade)**:

- Good style of coding (writing efficient and well-documentent code)
- Something in the work is exceptionally well done
- Some problem in the code is solved in a "smart" way
- The work is exceptionally well documented
- The visualizations are exceptionally good
- Additional features are added (eg. steps 5-6 in accesViz, or some other features that were not required)

**The workflow should be repeatable and well documented.** In other words, anyone who gets a copy of your repository should be able to run your code, and read your code.
