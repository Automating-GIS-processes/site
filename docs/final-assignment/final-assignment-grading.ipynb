    "|--------|------------|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Data preparation, analysis & visualization (24 pts)** | Reading and manipulating data | 0–6 | 0–1: Data read incorrectly or with major errors. <br> 2–3: Data read correctly but manipulation is minimal or partly incorrect. <br> 4–5: Data handling mostly correct with appropriate transformations. <br> 6: Data handling is fully correct, efficient, and well designed. |\n",
    "|  | Spatial / analytical methods | 0–6 | 0–1: Analysis missing or conceptually incorrect. <br> 2–3: Some correct steps but incomplete or weakly connected to the task. <br> 4–5: Analysis mostly correct and appropriate. <br> 6: Analysis is correct, appropriate, and clearly above minimum difficulty. |\n",
    "|  | Quality of visualizations | 0–6 | 0–1: Visualizations missing or very unclear. <br> 2–3: Visualizations exist but lack clarity or proper design. <br> 4–5: Clear and readable visualizations with minor issues. <br> 6: High-quality, informative, and well-designed visualizations. |\n",
    "|  | Code structure & functionality | 0–6 | 0–1: Code does not run or has major errors. <br> 2–3: Code runs partly but is poorly structured or repetitive. <br> 4–5: Code runs correctly and is reasonably modular. <br> 6: Code is fully functional, modular, and robust. |\n",
    "| **Documentation & presentation (8 pts)** | Problem & purpose description | 0–2 | 0: No description. <br> 1: Basic description with limited clarity. <br> 2: Clear and concise description of the problem and purpose. |\n",
    "|  | Usage & workflow explanation | 0–2 | 0: No usage description. <br> 1: Usage described briefly or unclearly. <br> 2: Clear explanation and demonstration of how to use the tool. |\n",
    "|  | Inputs & outputs explanation | 0–2 | 0: Inputs/outputs missing or unexplained. <br> 1: Inputs/outputs shown but poorly explained. <br> 2: All inputs and outputs are clearly presented and explained. |\n",
    "|  | Code readability & formatting | 0–2 | 0: Code is hard to read and poorly formatted. <br> 1: Code is readable but inconsistently formatted. <br> 2: Code is clean, readable, and follows PEP8 guidelines. |\n",
    "| **Other merits & added value (8 pts)** | Overall added value | 0–8 | 0–2: Minimal added value. <br> 3–4: Some added value (clean code, minor extras). <br> 5–6: Clear strengths (smart solutions, strong documentation, good visuals). <br> 7–8: Exceptional work (advanced features, elegant solutions, outstanding documentation or visuals). |\n",
    "| **Reproducibility (mandatory)** | Repeatable workflow | Required | The repository must run as provided. Missing or unclear instructions may result in point deductions across categories. |\n",
