    "- Reading and manipulating data\n",
    "- (Spatial) data analysis steps\n",
    "- Quality of visualizations (maps, graphs)\n",
    "- Is the code written in a modular way (avoid repetition eg. using functions and for-loops)\n",
    "- Does everything work as it should\n",
    "- Overall difficulty of the analysis task is taken into account in the assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall documentation of the work (1/5 of final grade)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a general description in about the research problem / purpose of the tool?\n",
    "- Is the usage of the tool/ available functions described and demonstrated clearly?\n",
    "- Are all input data and output results (maps, graphs) presented and explained clearly?\n",
    "- Is the code easy to read and well-formatted (following the PEP8 guidelines)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other merits in the work (~1/5 of final grade)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good style of coding (writing efficient and well-documentent code)\n",
    "- Something in the work is exceptionally well done\n",
    "- Some problem in the code is solved in a \"smart\" way\n",
    "- The work is exceptionally well documented\n",
    "- The visualizations are exceptionally good\n",
    "- Additional features are added (eg. steps 5-6 in accesViz, or some other features that were not required)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The workflow should be repeatable and well documented.** In other words, anyone who gets a copy of your repository should be able to run your code, and read your code.\n"
