    "In this course, we learned that visualization is a key tool for working with geospatial data. Different visualization methods have their own strengths and are suited for specific types of data or to explore certain aspects. While maps are a common way to show geospatial data, they're not the only method. Other ways of visualization can also be very helpful, either on their own or together with maps, to provide a better understanding of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discovered how to use geospatial data to tell stories. This involves combining different visualization methods with writing and other tools to share information in an engaging way. By doing this, we can make our data more interesting and easier for people to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telling stories with geospatial data is not just about showing where things are. It's about creating a narrative that helps people see why the data matters. We can use maps, charts, and interactive elements to make these stories more engaging. This way, we're not just sharing data; we're telling a story that connects with people. And this is what we are going to pratice and demonstrate in the **final portfolio**. \n",

    "- [**GBIF**](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?occurrence_status=present&q=) (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) provides a vast database of current biodiversity records, offering a rich resource to explore and study the distribution of species across the globe or in a certain area. The dataset is very comprehensive but of course not perfect. It is used a lot in ecology but at the same time the dataset has quite some issues (biased towards sampling in Europe vs. the rest of the world, misidentifications of species, imprecise coordinates, etc.). [Read more](https://peerj.com/articles/9916)\n",
    "- [**LAJI**](https://laji.fi/en) - Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility - is a similar national dataset if you want to focus you work on Finland. Compared to GBIF, this is more carefully curated and thus with less issues.\n",
    "- The [**ARCLIM**](https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/ARCLIM_bioclimatic_indices_for_the_terrestrial_Arctic/6216368/2) is a new data collection that presents a comprehensive set of bioclimatic indices specifically designed for the terrestrial Arctic, serving as a valuable dataset for those interested in understanding climate impacts on Arctic biodiversity and ecosystems. This collection offers insights into the climatic variables that shape the unique environmental conditions of the Arctic, facilitating studies on climate change and its ecological effects in this sensitive region.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **For University of Helsinki Students**: You're encouraged to use the university's blog service for creating your Cartography pages. If your blog is already used for other projects, no need to worry—you can get a second blog account (arrangements have been made). Simply reach out to IT or the course staff, preferably IT. Learn more about setting up your blog [here](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/setting-up-your-blog/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Students at Other Finnish Universities**: Your university might offer similar blogging or webpage creation services. It's worth checking to see if such options are available to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Platforms**: For those looking for different options or studying outside of Finland, GitHub Pages is a great, free choice for hosting your portfolio. It allows for the creation and hosting of web pages to display your projects. [Learn how to set up GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). There are countless other options that you can easily find by a simple search. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer not to publish your portfolio online, a PDF version is acceptable. Please communicate with the course staff to ensure there's a way to share your interactive visualizations, such as including links to hosted HTML pages or GitHub repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, it's **not needed** to publish your name or any personal identifiers on your public portfolio—it's entirely up to you what you choose to share.\n",
    "\n",
