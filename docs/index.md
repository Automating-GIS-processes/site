# Automating GIS Processes {{year}}

**Welcome to the *Automating GIS processes* course {{year}}!** Through interactive
lessons and hands-on exercises, this course introduces you to geographic data
analysis using the Python programming language. If you are new to Python, we
recommend you first start with the *Geo-Python* course
([geo-python.readthedocs.io](https://geo-python.readthedocs.io/)) before diving
into using it for GIS analyses in this course.

*Geo-Python* and *Automating GIS processes* (‘AutoGIS’) have been developed at
the Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki, Finland,
and the teaching material is openly available for anyone interested.

:::{admonition} Open Access
:class: info

Course material and videos are **open for everyone**. The aim of this course is
to share the knowledge and help people to get started with their journey
towards doing GIS analyses more efficiently and in a better reproducible
manner: using Python and its manifold modules. Feel free to share this website
with anyone interested, and use the provided material in your own teaching.

:::

After completing this course, a student is able to manage, analyse, and
visualise spatial data efficiently and in a systematic manner, using Python.
They also know how to evaluate available methods critically. Besides learning
how to handle, manipulate, and analyse geographic data (e.g., read and write
files, manage coordinate reference systems, conduct overlay analysis or network
analysis), students also get to know good programming practices, the benefits of
using a version control system (`git`), and how to document and communicate
their analysis workflow in an online repository (GitHub).
