# Exercise 5

:::{important}
Please complete this exercise
**by the end of day** on Thursday, 7 December, 2023
(the day of next week’s work session).
:::

To start this assignment, [accept the GitHub Classroom
assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/75b8ksXD), and clone *your own*
repository, e.g., in a [CSC
Notebook](../../course-info/course-environment)
instance. Make sure you commit and push all changes you make (you can
revisit instructions on how to use `git` and the jupyterlab git-plugin
on the [website of the Geo-Python
course](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html).

To preview the exercise without logging in, you can find the open course copy
of the course’s GitHub repository at
[github.com/Automating-GIS-processes-II-2023/exercise-5](https://github.com/Automating-GIS-processes-II-2023/exercise-5).
Don’t attempt to commit changes to that repository, but rather work with your
personal GitHub Classroom copy (see above).
