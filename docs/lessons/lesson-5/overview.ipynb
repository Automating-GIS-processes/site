    "> The goal of this lesson is to create maps from a technical point of view, so we do not focus much on the cartographical aspects. If you are interested in learning more about cartography, working with different libraries, making different visualizations and maps, or customizing your maps further, check out the open materials for the course [**Cartographic visualizations in GIS**](https://cartogis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offered at University of Helsinki.\n",
