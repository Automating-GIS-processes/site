    ":::{admonition} **Definitions**\n",
    "**Shapefile:** a vector data format for storing location information and related attributes.\n",
    "A shapefile consist of several files with a common prefix that need to be stored in the same directory.\n",
    "`.shp`, `shx` and `.dbf` are required file extensions in a shapefile. Other file extensions are not required,\n",
    "but for example the file extension `.prj` is often essential. More information about Shapefile file extensions\n",
    "in [here](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Shapefile_file_extensions/005600000003000000/)).\n",
    "The shapefile format is developed by ESRI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GeoPackage:** an open source format for storing and transferring geospatial information.\n",
    "GeoPackages are able to store both vector data and raster data. In more detail, GeoPackage is a container for\n",
    "an SQLite database with a `.gpkg` extension (all in one file!). The GeoPackage format is governed by the Open GeoSpatial Consortium.\n",
    "More information at: <https://www.geopackage.org/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**CRS:** Coordinate reference systems define how coordinates relate to real locations on the Earth.\n",
    "*Geographic coordinate reference systems* commonly use latitude and longitude degrees.\n",
    "*Projected coordinate reference systems* use x and y coordinates to represent locations on a flat surface.\n",
    "You will learn more about coordinate reference systems during this lesson!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datum:** defines the center point, orientation, and scale of the reference surface related to a coordinate reference system.\n",
    "Same coordinates can relate to different locations depending on the Datum! For example, WGS84 is a widely used global datum.\n",
    "ETRS89 is a datum used in Europe. Coordinate reference systems are often named based on the datum used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EPSG:** EPSG codes refer to specific reference systems.\n",
    "EPSG stands for “European Petroleum Survey Group” that originally published a database for spatial reference systems.\n",
    "For example, [EPSG:3067](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3067/) refers to coordinate reference system ETRS-TM35FIN which is commonly used in Finland.\n",
    "[EPSG:4326](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/) refers to WGS84. You can search for EPSG codes at: <https://spatialreference.org/>\n",
