# Overview

In this lesson, we will learn how to handle spatial data in Python using
[Geopandas](http://geopandas.org/). Geopandas combines the power of Pandas to
analyse tabular data and shapely for handling geometries.

We will learn how to read and write spatial data from and to files, how to
manipulate geometries, and how to transform data between different coordinate
reference systems (CRS).


## Learning goals

After this week, you should be able to:

- read and write spatial data from and to common file formats,
- filter and re-group data by spatial and non-spatial characteristics, and
- manage and transform a data setâ€™s coordinate reference system.
