    "\n",
    "When working with raster files or bands, one of the quickest ways to upset the mathematical gods of Python is to divide by zero. It’s like giving Python a riddle it can’t solve—it just throws its hands up (and an error). To  avoid this, you can replace the zero values with `NaN`. This way, Python knows how to handle `NaN`s . Here’s an example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Avoid division by zero by setting NDVI to NaN where NIR + Red is zero\n",
    "NDVI = NDVI.where((nir_data + red_data) != 0)\n",
