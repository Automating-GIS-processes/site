Slope analysis helps identify areas with steep gradients, which is useful in applications like land-use planning, erosion risk assessment, hydrological modeling, and infrastructure development. The slope is typically expressed in degrees or as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can perform slope analysis anywhere, including on the Helsinki city center raster we worked with earlier. However, for this course's purpose, it will be more interesting to calculate it for an area with more elevation variation. Since Finland is generally quite flat, we need to look further north to find terrain that is more elevation-wise interesting for slope analysis. For this purpose, we are heading to [YllÃ¤s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yll%C3%A4s) in Lapland, located in the northern part of Finland. YllÃ¤s is a fell, or mountainous hill, and offers more diverse elevation changes, making it ideal for our slope analysis!\n",

    "Raster-to-raster calculations involve performing mathematical or logical operations on two or more raster datasets to derive new information. Each raster grid cell is processed based on corresponding cells from the input rasters. This method is commonly used in geospatial analysis to perform tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combining terrain attributes**: Slope, aspect, and DEM can be used to calculate terrain stability or hydrological indices.\n",
    "- **Environmental modeling**: Calculating indices such as vegetation health (NDVI) using different raster bands.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Example: Slope Stability Index (SSI)**\n",
    "*SSI* is a basic measure to assess the potential stability of a terrain. It combines both the slope steepness and elevation of the terrain, providing an index that indicates the likelihood of a slope to remain stable. Steeper slopes and higher elevations tend to be more prone to instability, which can lead to phenomena such as landslides, rockfalls, or soil erosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Slope Stability Index can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",

    "- **Slope**: The steepness of the terrain, typically measured in degrees or percentage.\n",
    "- **Elevation (DEM)**: The height of the terrain above a reference point (usually sea level).\n",
    "- **SSI**: The lower the value of the SSI, the higher the instability risk. Conversely, higher values indicate more stable terrain.\n",
