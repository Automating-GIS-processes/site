    "\n",
    "## General overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are familiar with [the basics of Python\n",
    "programming](https://geopython.readthedocs.io/), it is time to apply those\n",
    "skills to geographic data analysis. During the ‘Automating GIS processes’\n",
    "course, you will learn how to handle spatial data and analyse it using Python.\n",
    "In the course, you also will get to know some of the many Python packages that\n",
    "have been written specifically for GIS-related applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the course you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **read and write spatial data** from and to different file formats,\n",
    "- work with **coordinate reference systems**,\n",
    "- use **geocoding** to convert addresses to coordinates, and vice versa,\n",
    "- use **overlay functions** to combine geometries (intersect, union),\n",
    "- **reclassify data** based on their value,\n",
    "- carry out **spatial queries**,\n",
    "- conduct simple **spatial analysis**, and\n",
    "- **visualise data** and create (interactive) maps, such as following:\n",

    "## Why Python for GIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to data science, and especially spatial data science and spatial\n",
    "data analysis, Python currently is the most useful programming or scripting \n",
    "language to learn. On the one hand, the Python ecosystem, which allows people to\n",
    "share their libraries easily with others, is very rich, and has packages for\n",
    "almost any task imaginable. Researchers who find that a particular tool does not\n",
    "exist, often go ahead and create it themselves. Python’s packages cover such a\n",
    "broad range of applications, that its `import` statement has become the trope of\n",
    "many jokes:\n",
    "\n",

    ":alt: I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday. It was wonderful. Perl, I'm leaving you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to do *anything* is easy in Python: there is a package for everything. *Source: [xkcd.com/353](https://xkcd.com/353/)*\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more advantages more specifically for geographers and spatial data:\n",
    "most desktop GIS (e.g., QGIS, ESRI ArcGIS) have language bindings or programming\n",
    "interfaces for Python: that means that you can write Python programs that\n",
    "interact with data, libraries, and user interface of these applications, and\n",
    "create custom plugins to extend their functionality. Beyond that, here are \n",
    "powerful Python packages for virtually any task regarding spatial data\n",
    "management and spatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this course, we will focus on the latter: carrying GIS analysis and data\n",
    "management tasks _without_ a desktop GIS, let alone a proprietary third-party\n",
    "software package such as ESRI ArcGIS. **Why?** There’s more than one reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python itself, and most packages for it, is open source. It means it’s **free\n",
    "  to use** (as in *free beer*), and **free to modify** for your own purposes (as\n",
    "  in *free speech*). Open source and *libre software* is inherently democratic:\n",
    "  you don’t have to rely on access to a license, and anybody across the globe can\n",
    "  use them. [Read more about *free beer* vs. *free speech* at the Free Software\n",
    "  Foundation’s web page](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)\n",
    "- Writing a script that solves a problem makes you **learn and understand more\n",
    "  deeply** how geo-processing operations work, and how they work together. In\n",
    "  this course, you will gain a deeper understanding of GIS.\n",
    "- Python is **efficient** and **scales** very well: You can use a Python script\n",
    "  to analyse *Big Data* and other large datasets, and it is likely to outperform\n",
    "  any desktop GIS tool.\n",
    "- Python is **highly flexible**: it can read and write almost any data format,\n",
    "  and its [package ecosystem](../../course-info/installing-python)\n",
    "  provides libraries for almost any programming task imaginable.\n",
    "- Using Python, or any other open source software, for what it’s worth, supports\n",
    "  the ideas of **open science** and **reproducable research**. Anyone can take\n",
    "  your code and repeat your experiment or analysis to verify your claims and to\n",
    "  learn from your example.\n",
    "- **Combining the functionality of different Python packages** you can achieve\n",
    "  surprising results with comparably low effort: e.g., building fancy web-GIS\n",
    "  applications by chaining\n",

    "## Which GIS packages are available in Python?\n",

    "used a few Python modules for carrying out different tasks, such as **numpy**\n",
    "for mathematical calculations, and **matplotlib** for data visualisation. In\n",
