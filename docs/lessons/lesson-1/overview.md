# Overview

Before we start to work with entire data sets next week, we first have to become
familiar with basic geometric objects (primitives): in the centre of this week’s
lesson stand points, lines, and polygons.

We will learn how to create and manipulate ‘simple features’ in Python, using
the Python package [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/).


## Learning goals:

After this lesson, you will be able to:
- find Python packages for GIS and spatial analysis,
- understand and describe how geometric objects (points, lines, polygons) are
  handled and stored by *shapely*, and
- create geometries given their coordinate values.
