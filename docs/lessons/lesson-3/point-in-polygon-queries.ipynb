    "Finding out if a certain point is located inside or outside of an area,\n",

    "spatial join (will be introduced later) between two spatial datasets is\n",
    "one of the most typical applications where Point in Polygon (PIP) query\n",
    "is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading about PIP and other geometric operations,\n",

    "## How to check if point is inside a polygon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, detecting if a point is inside a polygon is most commonly done using a specific formula called [Ray Casting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon#Ray_casting_algorithm).\n",
    "Luckily, we do not need to create such a function ourselves for\n",
    "conducting the Point in Polygon (PIP) query. Instead, we can take\n",
    "advantage of [Shapely's binary predicates](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html#binary-predicates)\n",
    "that can evaluate the topolocical relationships between geographical\n",

    "> ### Good to know: Ray-Casting Algorithm\n",
    "> The **ray-casting algorithm** is a common method used to determine whether a given point lies inside or outside of a polygon. This algorithm is widely used in spatial analysis and GIS.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### How It Works\n",
    "> - **Cast a Ray**: A ray (straight line) is extended from the point in question to infinity in one direction.\n",
    "> - **Count Intersections**: Count how many times this ray intersects with the edges of the polygon.\n",
    ">   - If the ray crosses the edges an **odd number of times**, the point is considered to be **inside** the polygon.\n",
    ">   - If it crosses an edge an **even number of times**, the point is **outside** the polygon.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ![Example of ray casting of a polygon](figs/ray-casting.png)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> *Example of ray casting of a polygon. Image from [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7991484).*\n",
    "> #### Why This Works\n",
    "> This method leverages the idea that a ray entering and exiting the polygon will cross an edge each time it enters or exits. An odd count of intersections means the point is \"trapped\" inside; an even count means it is outside.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### Use Cases and Limitations\n",
    "> - This method works well for both convex and concave polygons.\n",
    "> - Special cases like points on the polygon edge may need additional handling.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> #### **Test your understanding**\n",
    "> Can you write a Python code to implement this algrothm?"
