# Overview

In this lesson, we will learn about two interesting problem sets that GIS
professionals often come across. First, we will look at different options of
converting addresses into coordinates and vice versa, i.e. **geocoding**. Then,
we will learn how to carry out **spatial join** operations in geopandas, first
in the specific use case of finding points inside a polygon, then more
generally joining two data sets based on their locations.


## Learning goals

After this lesson, you should know how to:

- geocode addresses, i.e., convert a list of addresses into a list of coordinates,
- query whether a point is inside a polygon, and
- join two vector data sets based on their featuresâ€™ location
