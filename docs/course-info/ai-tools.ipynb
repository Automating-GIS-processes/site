    "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools using large language models (AI-LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, or DeepL, are changing the ways in which people produce content including software. Although these tools have great potential to expidite many tasks, and particularly writing code, it is important to note that one must understand the process/code that is produced in order to ensure it functions properly. As the goal of our course is to lean how to make good maps, we (the teachers) must be careful to ensure the use of AI tools does not compromise the learning goals of the course. Thus, we provide some guidelines for the use of AI tools below."
