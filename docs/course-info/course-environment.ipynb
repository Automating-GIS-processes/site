    "\n",
    "1. Head to [noppe.csc.fi](https://noppe.csc.fi), and log in with your\n",
    "   university credentials.\n",
    "2. Then, choose ‘Join workspace’, and enter the join code `aut-l8nfke8z`\n",
    "3. In the section ‘My workspaces’, you should now see ‘Automating GIS processes\n",

    "> Everything you save within the `my-work` directory *should* persist between runs. However, make sure you save finished and unfinished work also in another place, to be on the safe side, for instance, by committing and pushing it to [your personal git repository](#git-and-github-keep-track-of-changes).\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the core goals of this course (besides learning how to program) is to learn\n",
    "how to use [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)\n",
    "with [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and how to store your\n",

    "[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) is a version control\n",
    "software (developed by a rather famous Finn: Linus Torvalds - the creator of\n",
    "Linux) that is used to track and store changes in your files (e.g., software\n",
    "source code) and recording the history of past changes. Git stores files in a\n",
    "‘repository’, which you can simply think of as a directory tree containing all\n",
    "files related to a project. Git is widely used by professionals to keep track\n",
    "of their work and to collaborate with other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based git repository hosting service and\n",
    "social network. It is the world’s largest online storage space for collaborative\n",
    "working. It is a place to share your code either openly with the entire world,\n",
    "or only with your colleagues who work on the same project. GitHub provides an\n",
    "easy-to-use web-interface to your files, which you can use to explore code and\n",
    "documentation of many projects, for instance, the [source code of the teaching\n",
    "material of this course](https://github.com/automating-gis-processes/site).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both git and GitHub provide many more features than the ones mentioned here,\n",
