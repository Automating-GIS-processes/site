    "\n",
    "Especially on Windows, installing Python packages can sometimes become tricky,\n",
    "as dependencies between packages and dependencies on external libraries are\n",
    "difficult to manage there. At times, a specific tool might require an older\n",
    "version of a package, or even an older Python version. As mentioned earlier, it\n",
    "is also good practice to install packages from one source, primarily, such as\n",
    "from the same conda channel. Fortunately, there is a mechanism that allows us to\n",
    "keep the packages needed for different Python projects separated: **Python\n",
    "environments**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a *Python environment* is a separate local installation of\n",
    "all tools required for a particular task, including a Python interpreter, Python\n",
    "packages, and underlying libraries. Python has built-in, offical tools for\n",
    "managing environments: the [venv\n",
    "module](https://docs.python.org/library/venv.html) and the [virtualenv\n",
    "package](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/). However, there has been a time when GIS\n",
    "packages installed using these tools did not always function properly on\n",
    "Windows, because they relied on external libraries. This is why there exists a\n",
    "historically grown tendency to use `conda` to manage Python environments for\n",
    "geo-spatial applications. \n",
