Below you find the intended learning outcomes after each study week. Please use this table to monitor your learning progress: you can always go back to revisit a previous weekâ€™s material.

After **week 1**, you should be able to:

- Grasp the evolution of cartographic theory and its connection to contemporary map-making.
- Comprehend core map design principals, applying these to create compelling and effective visual representations.
- View cartography not only as a technical skill but also as an artistic endeavor.
- Recognize the importance of coordinate systems and map projections in crafting accurate maps.

After **week 2**, you should be able to:

- Understand how new technologies and the advent of big data have transformed cartography.

- Identify design elements that aesthetically enhance maps.
- Produce various types of maps to visualize dense point data, including point maps, grid maps, and heatmaps.
- Create visually appealing global static maps.
- Color theory and maps.

After **week 3**, you should be able to:

- Understand the art of storytelling with geospatial data.
- Grasp the principles of critical cartography.
- Visualize large-scale geospatial data.
- Acknowledge that geospatial data can be visualized in non-cartographic forms.

After **week 4**, you should be able to:

- Understand and mitigate the effects of map media on cartographic design.
- Create interactive visualizations.
- Publish your interactive maps online.
- Be aware of future trends in cartography.
- Narrate a geospatial story using a diverse range of media, methods, and tools.
