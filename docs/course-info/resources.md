# Resources

Of course, this course can not cover everything, and it would be presumptous to
assume so. Much of what we cover here has been learnt thanks to the countless
excellent books, tutorials and examples to programming in Python that are out
there in the great widths of the Internet. Please find, below, a list of good
places to look for further inspiration.

## Books

There are **no required textbooks** for this course. That said, these are
textbooks we would recommend if you want to deepen your knowledge further:
