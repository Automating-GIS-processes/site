## Browser based programming environment

The instructions in this course provide a programming environment that allows anyone to immediately try and run all sample code directly in the browser. This functionality is realised using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and the [CSC](https://csc.fi/)’s [Notebooks](https://notebooks.csc.fi/) (the latter are available to students and staff at Finnish universities, only).

<!-- Binder environment is controlled from [environment.yml](environment.yml).
CSC Notebooks are controlled separately from [https://github.com/Automating-GIS-processes/notebooks](https://github.com/Automating-GIS-processes/notebooks) -repository. -->
